### To run the project -

1. `pnpm i` or `npm i`
2. Start server - `pnpm server-dev` or `npm run server-dev`
3. Start Web-app - `pnpm dev` or `npm run dev`
4. Goto - http://localhost:5173

Note - Since I was facing a CORS error on the mock API server, I also created a Node.js server (with TWO APIs) in the same project.
